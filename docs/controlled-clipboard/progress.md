# Controlled clipboard progress

Baseline: merged `10ad0bea`; branch `weshofmann/feature/controlled-clipboard`,
Draft PR [#13](https://github.com/weshofmann/boxwarden/pull/13).

Published foundation `40eada6`: bounded shared transfer core, nonblocking locks,
and exact-generation supervisor handshake. Its hosted deterministic CI passed.
Pinned management SSH is the guest transport; clipboard bytes bypass actions and
journals. Busy operations refuse, ambiguous writes do not replay.

This checkpoint adds fixed guest framing and expiring generation-bound requests,
retained owner/SSH capability and session exclusion, desktop selection ownership,
and source installation/artifact pins. The supported adapter is Ubuntu 24.04
GNOME Wayland with Xwayland and logind controller affiliation; ambiguous desktops
and native X11 refuse. Guest-local privileged metadata reads identify executable
links only when ordinary same-user inspection is denied.

Verification: guest helper/source fixtures and focused Go/race checks passed.
The existing Go suite and hosted CI passed at the guest checkpoint. Real synthetic helper
checks passed Unicode/trailing LF, empty text and 1 MiB, later reads after writer
exit, and malformed/NUL/oversize rejection preserving the previous value.
These are helper checks, not production CLI or graphical application acceptance.

The four public CLI commands and private AppKit adapter are implemented. The
host adapter isolates blocking AppKit calls in a bounded child and restores
descriptor flags after owned I/O quiesces. Independent host/CLI and pinned Tart
viewer reviews found no remaining Important/Critical issue. The source patch and
separately signed Tart `2.32.1-boxwarden-clipboard-r3` are staged; the executable
SHA-256 is `1573e4be9a10087f8e5dce5dcc5718cfef4d5d0274c60d5e209ba1f13c49f7a6`
and the reproducible archive SHA-256 is
`b5f487c3b092b48d23819d2828c45b96f7c84816d51b5ca9dd68f3de64fa3a64`.
Full local Go and race suites passed using external scratch space. Source-only
host admission accepts the exact r3 identity; the installed toolchain and root
manifest have not changed. Real VM/window/menu acceptance is pending.

Independent guest review found an Important liveness gap: a blocked native GTK
call could outlive the preclaim Python signal deadline. The source correction
uses a kernel-enforced default SIGALRM until the native clipboard claim succeeds,
then disarms it before retaining ownership. Its regression first reproduced the
gap in a blocking C call and now passes; independent review confirmed native
initialization and claim stalls terminate at the deadline, while committed
owners survive. No new VM/golden qualification is claimed from source checks.

The first disposable guest lacked a running Xwayland process despite having
an active Wayland desktop. The helper now wakes Xwayland before its unchanged
strict desktop process proof. Its 59 guest tests, including native-call deadline
and first-use ordering cases, and fake ISO/finalization fixtures passed;
independent guest review found no remaining Important/Critical issue. After
staging this helper only in the disposable probe, public stop/start produced a
new READY generation. From a cold baseline with no Xwayland process, public
CLI `copy`/`paste` passed exact Unicode/trailing LF, valid empty text, and
1 MiB. Invalid UTF-8, NUL, oversize, and stale-generation requests refused
without changing the destination. Full-host doctor and final session readiness
passed; no Mac pasteboard was accessed. Hosted deterministic CI passed at
`dc3bf28` ([run 36357415006](https://github.com/weshofmann/boxwarden/actions/runs/36357415006))
and at the documentation checkpoint `f232d4b`
([run 36357937418](https://github.com/weshofmann/boxwarden/actions/runs/36357937418)).

A separate synthetic GTK 3 TextView application then pasted exact text after
the public CLI copy had exited. A second TextView copied exact text that the
public CLI paste read later: 25 and 23 bytes respectively, including Unicode
and trailing newlines. The bounded private test used the guest's existing GTK
library and left the exact disposable session READY. Its independent source
review found no Important/Critical issue. This proves application-widget
interoperability, not Firefox behavior or the patched host viewer controls.
The disposable probe was then stopped through the public workflow and verified
stopped; host doctor remained healthy. Demo D remains running and untouched.

Independent cumulative review of the feature diff against merged `main` found
no remaining Important/Critical issue. The signed patched Tart is staged beside
the stock executable at its exact digest. Read-only host admission preflight
passed exact mounts, original backups, both executable identities, signature,
and doctor. A private attended cutover/rollback helper passed synthetic atomic
file replacement and refusal checks and independent source review. It has **not**
run with administrator privileges or changed the installed admission. Its
all-stopped/no-new-starts requirement means the running demo must be stopped
gracefully before the cutover.

Next: obtain the single concrete attended approval for temporary host-toolchain
admission and a synthetic Mac clipboard test window; then verify real viewer
buttons, menus, target selection and later guest application paste. Host
buttons/menus and the real host-clipboard GUI path remain untested until then.

Valuable demo D is untouched; one disposable probe is used. No real host clipboard
has been accessed. Deployment remains a separate concrete approval gate.
