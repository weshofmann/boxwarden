# Boxwarden v0.2 alpha decisions

## Initial scope and environment, 2026-09-23

- Use a private alpha context alongside the admitted host toolchain. The
  existing personal context and protected historical VM stay untouched. This
  gives the alpha exact state ownership without migrating old records.
- Prove the offline-inspector launch and transfer capabilities before fixing
  workspace APIs. Tart 2.32.1 advertises read-only file-backed disk attachment,
  but the current backend launcher always enables Softnet and provides no
  inspector transport. CLI help is a capability clue, not an isolation test.
- The initial graphical agent client candidate is the official ChatGPT Linux
  preview for Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64. [Official OpenAI documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/linux/linux-app)
  lists ARM64 packages and says Computer Use is unavailable on Linux preview.
  An official IDE integration is the fallback if guest installation/launch
  fails. An unauthenticated launch test does not prove agent task completion.
- Preserve v0.1's fixed host launch and guest-root threat model until a typed
  v0.2 contract changes them deliberately. The independent review found that
  management READY composition and nonexclusive SSH require coordinated guest
  helper, protocol, host runtime, and test changes.
